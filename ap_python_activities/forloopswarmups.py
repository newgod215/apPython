# 1. In your own words, describe what a for loop is?
used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# 2. What is the difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop?
# Provide two (2) examples of each. 
while loop: 1-execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
2-requires relevant variables to be ready
for loops: 1 - just like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
2-for loop can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
# 3. Create a FOR loop that will go through a list of names 
# and print all the names that start with the letter "R".
