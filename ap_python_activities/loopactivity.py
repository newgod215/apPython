# 1. Provided below is some starter code. 
# Fix this code to create a loop that will iterate
# until it gets to the number 10.

# hint: remember there are 3 parts to a loop. 
i=0
while i = 0.
    print('i < 10')
    print(i)
    if i =1
    

# 2. Create a simple while loop that will iterate over a the following condition:
# The loop will ask the user to enter the secret number. The secret number is 3. 
# If the user enters the secret number correctly, the loop will stop and tell the user
# the can win a prize. 
# If the user puts in an incorrect secret number, the loop will ask them to enter the 
# correct secret number. 
if the_secret_number = 3
 print(3 < prize)
else  the secret number isnt 3
print(2 < no prize)

# 3. describe the difference between a while loop and a conditional statement. 
# Try be as specific as you can
A while loop will run as many times as it needs to while a condition is true, i.e., 
until that condition is false. An if statement will execute once if a condition is true.

# 4. Create a while loop that will iterate over the list of names 
# and print out only the following name: William


list of names ['Avery','Paige','William','Ade','Jasmyn','Crystal']

index = 1
names = ['Avery', 'William', 'ade' , 'Paige' , 'Jasmyn' , 'Crystal']

for i in names: 
  print(index, '.' ,' ', i, sep='')
  index += 1

#OUTPUT:
#1. Avery
#2. William
#3. ade
#4. Paige
#5.Jasmyn
#6.Crystal

# 5. Create a  loop that will ask the user to add a new string value to the list of names above.
# hint you will need use append().
