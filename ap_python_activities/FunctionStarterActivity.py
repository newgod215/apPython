# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is
A function that does something
Code that a computer can read and transform into data. 

# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
# the difference between the 2.
A parameter is a variable in the declaration of the function. An argument is the actual value of the variable that gets passed to the function.

# 3. Write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a user's name. You will need to use parameters and arguments
hello{Jaseil}
myFunction(hello)

# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
number_of_pencils:100
number_of_pens:213
print{numberA + numberB}
print{100+213}
# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard-coded data.
print hello{Jaseil}
print(myFunction(){welcome_to_coding_class})
print(myFunction(){next_class_math})
