# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is
 a relation between a set of inputs having one output each.

# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
# the difference between the 2.
A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value.

# 3. Write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a user's name. You will need to use parameters and arguments
greeting{makai}
print{ welcome to python class}

# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
number_of_pencils:100
number_of_pens:213
print{numberA + numberB}
print{100+213}
# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard-coded data.
print greeting{makai}
print {welcome_to_coding_class}
print{next_class_math}
