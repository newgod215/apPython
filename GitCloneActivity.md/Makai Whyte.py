1. Was it easy to find your classmates assignment? Yes
2. Was their documentation clear and concise on what their program was designed to do? also yes
3. Was their documnetion clear and concise on how to install their program? again also yes
4. When you installed and ran your classmates program, did it work as described? It was pretty good when I ran it
5. Based on your experience using your classmate's program, as well as what you've learned about programming and documentation,
are there any reccomendations that you would provide to your classmate? #Makai has a very different way of thing about coding than me so I look up to the 
#way he thinks when it comes to this class so I dont have much to recomend to him.
