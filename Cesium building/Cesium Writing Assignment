The Trip had given me  the oppurtunity to speak with the Cesium team it was a great experience.
This oppurtunity helped me in a small way with my future career. This lead me to opening my eyes to different was of what I want to do with tech in the future and i'll say that this was the right trip for me. I was able to speak confidently and lound enough even tho I was sick. With this trip Im ready for any other oppurtunites coming my way.

My main question was (What is it like work at the cesium building). I didn't get to ask it but I was ansewred along the way. Everyone had they're own reason for working and it lead them in the long run. I feed off of my peers questions making my open my eyes to different ways of using tech. It's better for me to listen to my peers and people around me to retain information.

My experience at the cesium was great for my first trip to a coding office. It lead me to understand what I want to do with my game devlopment. I plan on using this information that the team gave to the class and use it for my self. I can't wait for the coding project coming up.
